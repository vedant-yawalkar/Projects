1. Clone the repository:

There are two things in the project.
Initially there are urls for authentication.
Later there is the logic written for query and query data.
The file upoad functionality is also added to the project.
    'admin/' # Django admin
    '', # By default Signup Page
    'login/' 3 Login Page
    'home/' # Home Page
    'logout/' #Logout Page

The above are the urls to get the respective pages for the file.

Next the logic required for the project and the functionality can be accessed by :
    'csv/upload/'  # Upload the file using this url
    'csv/query/' # Give all the data 
    'csv/query_count/'  #Let us query over the data
